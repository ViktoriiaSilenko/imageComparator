It is a program in Java that compares any 2 images and shows the differences visually.
The output of the comparison is a copy of one of the images image with differences outlined with red rectangles as shown below.
Pixels (with the same coordinates in two images) can be visually similar, but have different values of RGB. 
We should only consider 2 pixels to be &quot;different&quot; if the difference between them is more than 10%.
